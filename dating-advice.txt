Try apps or online dating if youâ€™re struggling to find romance within your social circle. Many people rely on 
websites like Match or apps like OkCupid, Tinder, Hinge, or Bumble to meet romantic prospects. If you're having 
a hard time finding potential dates among people you know or encounter often, apps like these can connect you
 to people you might not otherwise meet.
